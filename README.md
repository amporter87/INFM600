In order to examine whether or not the "Well-Being index" has any impact on the Average total payments of hospitals at the State level, three public datasets were used for analysis:

1. Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2011 (original data was updated in 2014). Accessed from: https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3
